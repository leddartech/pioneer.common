# dataset to use to generate homologs
# this dataset platform.yml should contain the required intrinsics section
# for the cameras and leddars. Also, the platform.yml should contain the
# chessboard description that we want to use to calibrate. Ideally you will
# predetect the chessboards in all cameras using the
# cam_intrinsics_calibration.py script
